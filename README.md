# 🍕 Pizza Price Prediction Based on Diameter

This project implements a machine learning system to predict pizza prices based on their **diameter** using a **Linear Regression** model. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use tool for price estimation, making it especially useful for pizzerias looking to optimize their pricing strategy. 💡

## Overview
The system predicts the price of a pizza by analyzing its **diameter**, using **Linear Regression** as the machine learning model. An interactive **Streamlit** interface allows users to estimate pizza prices by simply inputting the diameter, providing a practical tool for pizzerias to adjust prices based on size. 🍕

Key features of this project:
- 📊 Predicts pizza prices based on diameter
- 🤖 Uses a Linear Regression model for accurate predictions
- 🖥️ Provides an interactive interface using Streamlit, making it easy to use for non-technical users
- 💵 Optimizes pricing strategies for pizzerias

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project will be available in the repository. It contains records of pizza prices and their corresponding diameters. 📂
